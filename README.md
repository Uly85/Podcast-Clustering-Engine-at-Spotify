## Introduction and Background Research 

### **Spotify Podcast : “Digital audio series - Driving Growth Through Personalization”** 

**What is the background project?** 

⊹ Spotify is known for its personalized playlist feature. 

⊹ Spotify relies on machine learning to create recommendations based on users’ engagement data. 

⊹ Refer to HBS recommendations1 : “using NLP to analyze podcast content to improve personalized playlist feature” Why is this project interesting? 

⊹ By implementing NLP techniques to analyze podcast data/metadata (show description, episode description, transcript), we can validate podcasters’ descriptions of its content for classification.  

**Business Use Case**

Where we are now

⊹ The significant growth of total monthly Spotify active users: 19% year over year, to 381 million in Q3 (up from 365 million)

⊹ Spotify Premium subscribers: 19% to 172 million in the quarter.

⊹ However no platforms provide recommendations for podcasts.

⊹ Existing recommendation tool: Spotify’s Find the One online quiz (asks only a handful of questions, recommend the podcasts based on user responses)

**Where we want to go**

Build a classifier to help listeners discover new podcasts episodes or series

⊹ Using Spotify Podcast Data Set, we want to implement NLP techniques to provide a sophisticated recommendation lists by performing classification.
